# Harary_graphs
Visualisation of the three cases (not coloured graphs)


This has the construction for the three different harary graphs for a fixed 'n' value (no. of vertices) and 'k' value..
By choosing the appropriate values, graphs can be vizualised.
Case 1 : n-even/odd, k-even
Case 2 : n-even, k-odd
Case 3 : n-odd, k-odd

P.S: Make sure to have "igraph" loaded before using these programs in r
